# ARA Audio Random Access: API specification

Copyright (c) 2012-2023, [Celemony Software GmbH](https://www.celemony.com), All Rights Reserved.
Published under the Apache 2.0 license.

The ARA_API Git repository contains the technical specifications of the ARA API. It is intended to be
used as a submodule when building ARA-enabled products.

Developers should download the [full ARA_SDK repository](https://github.com/Celemony/ARA_SDK) which
includes this repository along with extensive library code, full documentation and detailed example code.

Any public release of ARA-enabled software should be based on a tagged public release of the ARA API.
If temporarily using HEAD to study current work-in-progress, keep in mind that in order to achieve a
concise long-term change history, any changes since the last tagged release may eventually be rebased.

Note that similar to operating system APIs such as the Linux kernel API, implementing the ARA API in any
host or plug-in as intended is considered normal use and does *not* make that software a "derived work".
