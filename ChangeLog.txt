This is a development build of the ARA API 2.3.
=== PRELIMINARY - DO NOT USE FOR SHIPPING PRODUCTS! ===


Proposed Features which have been postponed to a later subrelease:
- integration of plug-in undo history integration into the host
- support for dynamic tuning such as Hermode (previous draft temporarily removed)
- support for automatic adaption of tuning and harmonic context (previous draft temporarily removed)


Proposed Features currently scheduled targeted for this subrelease:
- full AAX Companion API integration
- waveform envelope overview (previous draft had been temporarily removed until after ARA 2.0 release)


Changes since previous releases:
- initial draft of Audio Unit version 3 support (App Extension, incl. IPC when not loaded in-process)
- initial draft of CLAP support
- required minimum CMake version increased from 3.4 to 3.19 (same as VST3)


=== ARA SDK 2.2 release (aka 2.2.001) (2022/11/07) ===
- added surround support for audio sources
- added API to determine whether an audio modification actually modifies the underlying audio source


=== ARA SDK 2.1 release (aka 2.1.001) (2022/01/06) ===
- finalized ARM support for Apple Silicon
- enable ARA audio file chunk authoring directly in the host


=== ARA SDK 2.0 release (aka 2.0.001) (2021/05/03) ===
- outdated documentation for ARAFactory::factoryID fixed, related chapter "Managing ARA Archives" rewritten
- clarified undo stack handling if host edits trigger follow-up updates in the plug-in
- clarified threading constraints for creating/destroying ARA plug-in instances
- clarified intended use cases and optimization criteria for ARA audio file chunks
- clarified possible line feeds in base64 encoding of ARA audio file chunk archive data

ARA SDK 2.0 draft 14 (aka 1.9.14) (2021/02/26)
- applied Apache License 2.0
- processing algorithm selection draft finalized for release
- added API for license management if using ARA plug-ins without UI as analysis or time-stretch engine
- clarified how to support multiple ARA audio processors in a single VST3 binary (e.g. WaveShell)
- clarified life time of ARAFactory pointers obtained through ARA::IPlugInEntryPoint or ARA::IMainFactory
- drafted ARM support (still experimental and bound to change in incompatible ways!)
- removed now-obsolete transitional switch ARA_HEADER_LIKE_V1
- clarifications for handling multiple VST3 components within the same binary
- pdf documentation overhauled, many improvements and clarifications
- added initial CMake support, still work-in-progress

ARA SDK 2.0 draft 13 (aka 1.9.13) (2020/08/12)
- Audio Units: adding AudioComponent tag to quickly identify ARA plug-ins when using the system-wide Audio Unit caching
- VST3: defined call order between bindToDocumentControllerWithRoles () and getProcessContextRequirements () (added in VST 3.7.0)
- various small improvements and clarifications in pdf documentation, document structure improved

ARA SDK 2.0 draft 12 (aka 1.9.12) (2020/06/12)
- re-introduced updated version of processing algorithm selection draft
- replaced remaining draft markups with final markup (tuning & harmonics content, audio file chunks)
- renamed kARAContentUpdatePitchScopeRemainsUnchanged to kARAContentUpdateTuningScopeRemainsUnchanged for consistency
- clarified length 0 in playback or modification time is valid for playback regions
- now using more modern C++ in core headers, dropped C++98 support in favor of C++11

ARA SDK 2.0 draft 11 (aka 1.9.11) (2020/04/02)
- relaxed restrictions for UI notifications to allow for more concise UI update handling
- clarified not to notify content changes when restoring data
- clarified not to notify content changes in response to receiving content changes
- clarified time based vs. object based host selection

ARA SDK 2.0 draft 10 (aka 1.9.10) (2020/03/13)
- clarifying persistency of deactivation state for audio sources and audio modifications
- hosts are no longer required to close any UI before dactivating audio modifications
- pdf documentation revamped to be more compact

ARA SDK 2.0 draft 9 (aka 1.9.9) (2019/12/06)
- initial draft of ARA-specific audio file chunk format for embedding audio source state (analysis data)
  this also enables drag&drop between hosts and plug-ins
- revised persistent ID mapping for partial persistency
  CAREFUL: previous draft is no longer compatible and will cause crashes!
- added required new call getDocumentArchiveID () to ARAArchivingControllerInterface
- revised documentation for partial persistency
- initial draft to read waveform envelope data for efficient display of output audio signal
- clarified threading constraints for audio readers: single-threaded per reader,
  but multiple readers can be used concurrently

ARA SDK 2.0 draft 8 (aka 1.9.8) (2019/06/28)
- relaxed rules about content reading functions only being callable while document is not in
  editing state: no state changes may be triggered while making the calls, but they are now
  valid to make between begin- and endEditing()
- clarified usage of name field in ARAContentTuning, ARAContentKeySignature and ARAContentChord
- introduced proper ARAAPIGeneration typedef instead of using plain ARAInt32
- merged Doxygen-based ARA_API_Reference.pdf into ARA_SDK.pdf
- clarifications and fixes in pdf documentation

ARA SDK 2.0 draft 7 (aka 1.9.7) (2019/03/04)
- minor tweaks to analysis algorithm properties draft
- removed draft for content tags from ARA 2 due to very limited interest in supporting it
  (content tags may re-appear in some later release if more broadly requested)
- clarified potential data alignment issues for ARA structs

ARA SDK 2.0 draft 6 (aka 1.9.6) (2018/9/19)
This is the public release of kARAAPIGeneration_2_0_Draft.
For changes compared earlier versions, see Version.txt in that release of the SDK.
